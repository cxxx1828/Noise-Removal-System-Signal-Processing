This project implements fixed-point FIR and IIR digital filters for real-time noise reduction on the TI TMS320C5535 DSP. The system removes dominant noise components at 308 Hz and 2 kHz using a low-pass FIR filter followed by a second-order IIR notch filter. All filter coefficients are scaled and adapted for fixed-point arithmetic, and the program demonstrates proper coefficient quantization, signal normalization, and processing pipeline setup. The implementation includes test input, expected output, and a brief verification of filtering effects for evaluation on the DSP development board.
